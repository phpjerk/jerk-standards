# Contributing to the PHP-FIG

Anybody who acts like a jerk, is part of the PHP-JS. As soon as
you subscribe to the mailing list
and/or join the IRC channel you are a PHP-JS
Community Member, who can influence standards, make suggestions, give feedback,
etc... though, honestly, no one gives a fuck what you think. Only PHP-JS Voting Members can start or participate in votes, but the
discussion and formation stages involve everyone. In the end, my vote is the only one that matters, so you can fuck right off.
