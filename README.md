PHP Jerk Standards Group
====================================

The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the
commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main
audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community
is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to
do so, but that is not the aim. Our aim is global domination and beating all PHP 
developers to a bloody pulp with various standards they need to adopt.


Proposing a Standards Recommendation
------------------------------------

To propose a jerk recommendation (PJR):

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the PJR in
  `proposed/`, push the branch to Github, and send a pull request; or,

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github; or,

- start a conversation on the mailing list.

- weep bitterly as we ignore you and call you names


Requesting Membership
---------------------

You **do not** need to be a voting member to participate in discussion on
the mailing list.

To become a voting member, you must send an email to me.

- The subject line should read: `Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})`

- The body should include your name, the name of (and link to) the project you
  represent, and other details you feel are relevant.

- Current members will vote on your request.

- Your request will be denied because we hate you.

- We will post your request and say horrible, horrible things about your family.

Do not combine separate membership requests in a single thread; one request
per thread, please.
